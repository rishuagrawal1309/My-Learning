<h1>Git revert command</h1>
<h2>Git Revert Command</h2>
<p>The <code>git revert</code> command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit. Unlike <code>git reset</code>, which can alter the commit history, <code>git revert</code> is a safe way to undo changes because it preserves the history of the repository.</p>
